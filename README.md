## Project Euler in some mildly fancy languages

Optimised for readability (I am not a miser about newlines like actual haskellers). 

Actually guess that's not true since I'm a lazy bastard and never say my types.

`runhaskell` is often unbearably slow, but most of these run in <2s with `ghc -O2`.

I always solve the general case, but am happy to add hacky and approximate shortcuts to that.
