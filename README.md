## Project Euler in some mildly fancy languages

### Haskell

Aiming for zero imports.

Optimised for readability (I am not a miser about newlines like actual haskellers). Actually I guess that's not true, since I'm a lazy bastard and never say my types.

`runhaskell` is often unbearably slow, but most of these run in <2s with `ghc -O2`.

I always solve the general case, but am happy to add hacky and approximate shortcuts.
