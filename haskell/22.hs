{-
    begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. 
    Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, 
    multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

    For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, 
    which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, 
    is the 938th name in the list. 
    So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

    What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
