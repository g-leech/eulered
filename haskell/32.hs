    d with length n is pandigital if it has all digits 1 to n exactly once; 
    d = 15234 is 1 through 5 pandigital.

    The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, 
    containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

    Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as 
    a 1 through 9 pandigital.

    Some products have dupes

    bound: 987654321 is the largest pandigital. We can do better.
    
    What magnitudes give us 9 digits total?
        (length 2) x (length 3); (ab)*(cde) = efgh
            Lowest 12 * 345 gives 4 digits, 98 * 765 gives 5
        length 1 x length 4;
            5 * 9876
    Either way, product has to be 4 digits (9-5). So ab < 10000 

    I got bored so: amax = 9876     bmax = 98
